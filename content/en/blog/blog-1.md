title: "AI Killed My All Coding Brain and I Create It Again"
description: "İşte o zaman anladım: Copilot, Cursor ve CodeWhisperer gibi yapay zeka araçları parmaklarımızı yavaş yavaş uyuşturdu. Her zamankinden daha hızlı kod yazıyoruz ama aynı zamanda daha az düşünüyoruz. Ritüeller gibi tekrarlayan komutları kullanıyoruz. Otomatik tamamlamayı kutsal kitap gibi kabul ediyoruz. Kodun neden çalıştığını unutup, sadece işe yaradığına seviniyoruz."

Introduction: How did I forget how to code?

#description
Have you ever looked at your screen and forgotten how a for loop works?

Exactly. Specifically, Lua's for loop. I was on a new machine, hadn't logged into Copilot, and was sitting there like a deer in the headlights, staring at the syntax.::

It was at this point that I began to look more critically at the automated parts of software practice. We thought we were thinking when we were writing code, but in fact, we were just guessing.
We just dismiss the code suggested by AI without questioning it. We've gained speed, but we've lost meaning. We've lost the essence of code. In this article, I'll try to rebuild my own coding habits.
