title: "Google confirms the reality of artificial intelligence that many programmers desperately try to deny"
description: "See? All these people are still treating AI-assisted coding like it's some gimmick no one uses in production. Some people in my comments even said that using AI tools doesn't make you more productive... Come on, I thought we all agreed that GitHub Copilot was a hit. Wasn't that evidenced by their 1.3 million+ paid users this time last year? In case you didn't know, software developers aren't easy to monetize; your tool has to be something to get 1.3 million+ people to pay for it. And even if most of those come from businesses, something tells me not every developer tool from B2B can come close to those numbers."

As you can see, this is currently happening at top software companies with billions of lines of active code.
#description
All these people are still acting like AI-powered coding is a gimmick no one actually uses in production.
Some people in my comments even said that using AI tools doesn't make you more productive...

Oh my gosh, I thought we all agreed that GitHub Copilot was a hit. Wasn't their 1.3 million+ paid users this time last year proof enough?
In case you didn't know, software developers aren't an easy bunch to monetize; your tool has to be something for over 1.3 million people to actually pay for it.
And even if most of them come from businesses, something tells me not every developer tool from B2B can even come close to those numbers.
