title: "GPT-5 geliyor, lansmandan önce sızdırılan her şey burada"
description: "GPT-5 artık soyut bir sonraki sürüm değil, ufukta beliriyor. Ve şimdiden yapay zekaçevrelerinde, geliştirici topluluklarında ve hatta OpenAI nin kendisinde yankı uyandırmaya başladı. İşaretler her yerde: beklenmedik model güncellemeleri, muğlak tweetler, şüpheli derecede dikkatli ifadelerle yazılmış röportajlar ve tabii ki, Tanrı'nın işini yapan eski güzel Reddit dedektifleri."

GPT-5 is no longer an abstract "next version"; it's looming on the horizon. And it's already making waves in AI circles, developer communities, and even OpenAI itself. The signs are everywhere: unexpected model updates, vague tweets, suspiciously carefully worded interviews, and, of course, good old Reddit detectives doing God's work.

Unlike previous versions, where OpenAI made a flashy announcement with a landing page and some technical documentation, GPT-5 is rising like a storm cloud. Silent. Ominous. Powerful.

Unlike previous versions, which OpenAI flashily announced with a splashy landing page and some technical documentation, GPT-5 is rising like a storm cloud. Quiet. Ominous. Powerful.

We're not here to make predictions; we'll be tracking real-world indicators: hiring trends, alpha releases, Reddit leaks, sudden performance spikes, and that developer who swears GPT-5 figured out his company's billing logic "better than our entire backend team."

Whether you're developing AI-powered tools or just using ChatGPT to write bash scripts and convincing excuses, this is one update you won't want to think about...
